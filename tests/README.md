# Test Applications

Here we have two test applications, demonstrating the two basic modes of the
love-build action.

 - **Hello World**: In this example we demonstrate the bare bones build process,
   with no dependencies.

 - **Game of Life**: Here we show an example with LuaRocks dependencies,
   namely a little demonstration of Conway's Game of Life using the forma
   package.

The GitHub Actions workflow to build these applications is located
[here](../.github/workflows/master.yml).
